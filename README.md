# Usability Evaluation and Prototyping (again)
> Usability Evaluation in this assignment is to evaluate your high-fidelity interactive-prototype with two participants:
> the participant from the previous Contextual Inquiry (CI) and an additional novice-participant.
> Respectively, revise your prototype as an attempt to fix any problems found in this Usability Evaluation.

## Operating the Prototype
> Record a video (screen-recording is preferred) while you operating your prototype.
> Present the ideal case on how to interact with the prototype from the beginning to the end.
> Upload the video on any video-sharing website (e.g., YouTube), then attach the video link on this report.

## Part A: Usability Evaluation
> In this part, you should prepare your high-fidelity interactive-prototype from the assignment 2.
> Invite the participant from your previous CI to test the prototype.
> You also need to invite one more novice participant.
> As with the CI, you might need to videotape your sessions.
> You can benefit from the videotape while writing your `Recording Transcript` later.

### Brief Description of Participants
> Describe your participants in bullets or sentences.
> The description should contain their demographic (age, gender, occupation),
> their skill level in using the system, and your reasons choosing them.
> The description should NOT contain any personally identifiable information.

#### Description of Participant 1
 - The Quick 
 - Brown Fox 
 - Jumps Over 
 - The Lazy Dog

#### Description of Participant 2
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

### Evaluation Script
> Write the questions you ask and the instructions you use to direct the participants on what to do.
> If it is the same as previous assignments, please mention this, yet go ahead and INCLUDE it again,
> so we have everything in one place.
> Note that the evaluation script must include exactly what you plan to say to the participants.

### Transcript
> Provide a summary of what the participant did and said, and what you did and said.
> If at some points you have to help the participants, because they cannot figure out what to do,
> that scene must be included in the transcript.
> It is not necessary to write down every word the participant said,
> just what is interesting and useful.
> Ensure to write down all the actions on the device, whether correct or wrong.
> Remember to supplement the transcript with time-codes or line-numbers.

### Feedback and Incidence Analysis
> Record your observations per prototype screen followed by reference, feedback, incidence, reason, and resolution.

#### OBSERVATION 1
![Prototype Screen 1](https://www.europassitalian.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bravolol-app-screenshot-1-635x1128.png)

 - **Reference**: Provide line-number(s) or time-code(s) referred by feedback/incidence observed on the screen.
 - **Feedback**: Provide feedback (positive or negative) given by the participants, if any.
 - **Incidence**: Critical incidences (breakdowns or problems encountered by the participants) and/or mistakes committed by the participants.
 - **Reason**: Explain the reason for the breakdowns or the negative feedback observed on the screen.
 - **Resolution**: Suggest any modifications that might be made to the UI to address the issues in this `OBSERVATION 1`.
 
#### OBSERVATION 2

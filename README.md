# Usability Evaluation and Prototyping (again)
Usability Evaluation in this assignment is to evaluate your high-fidelity interactive-prototype with two participants:
the participant from the previous Contextual Inquiry (CI) and an additional novice-participant.
Respectively, revise your prototype as an attempt to fix any problems found in this Usability Evaluation.

## Part A: Usability Evaluation
In this part, you should prepare your high-fidelity interactive-prototype from the assignment 2.
Invite the participant from your previous CI to test the prototype.
You also need to invite one more novice participant.
As with the CI, you might need to videotape your sessions.
You can benefit from the videotape while writing your `Recording Transcript` later.

### Brief Description of Participants
Describe your participants in bullets or sentences.
The description should contain their demographic (age, gender, occupation),
their skill level in using the system, and your reasons choosing them.
The description should *not* contain any personally identifiable information.

#### Description of Participant 1

#### Description of Participant 2

### Evaluation Script
Write the questions you ask and the instructions you use to direct the participants on what to do.
If it is the same as previous assignments, please mention this, yet go ahead and *include* it again,
so we have everything in one place.
Note that the evaluation script must include *exactly what you plan to say to the participants*.

### Transcript
Provide a summary of what the participant did and said, and what you did and said.
If at some points you have to help the participants, because they cannot figure out what to do,
that scene must be included in the transcript.
It is not necessary to write down every word the participant said,
just what is interesting and useful.
Ensure to write down all the actions on the device, whether correct or wrong.
Remember to supplement the transcript with time-codes or line-numbers.

### Feedback and Incidence Analysis
Record your observations per prototype screen containing:

#### Observation 1
![Prototype Screen 1](https://picsum.photos/540/960/?random)

 - **Reference**: Provide line-number(s) or time-code(s) referred by feedback/incidence observed on the screen.
 - **Feedback**: Provide feedback (positive or negative) given by the participants, if any.
 - **Incidence**: Critical incidences (breakdowns or problems encountered by the participants) and/or mistakes committed by the participants.
 - **Reason**: Explain the reason for the breakdowns or the negative feedback observed on the screen.
 - **Resolution**: Suggest any modifications that might be made to the UI to address the issues in this `Observation 1`.
 
#### Observation 2
